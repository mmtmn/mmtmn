I'm in love with the universe. I find it fascinating and a little scary at the same time.

I have a background in economics and I'm currently at my 3rd year in Computer Science. I've worked professionaly as a junior backend developer for letrus.
Currently completly in love with the science of the computers. I love reading books but I also love to get practical about the theory that I am reading, that is why this subject has suited me super well.

Currently class representative of UNIP's Computer Science graduating class of 2022.
