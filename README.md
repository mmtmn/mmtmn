I'm in love with the enigma about the universe by which we live in. I find it fascinating and a little scary at the same time.

With a background in economics, I'm currently in the 3rd year (out of 4) of majoring in Computer Science, working hard to get the bachelor's degree. I've worked professionaly as a junior backend developer for a company called Letrus. Currently with great grades across all semesters, **among the top of the class on the average of total grades in all semesters.**




Currently completly in love with the science of computers, software, hardware, especially the physics and mathematical part of it all. I love reading books but I also love to get practical about the theory that I am reading/studying about, that is why this subject has suited me super well.
